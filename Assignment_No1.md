## **Use Case: E-commerce**

### **Introduction**
E-commerce platforms rely heavily on data-driven decision-making to enhance customer experience. This assignment explores how data is used to identify consumers, recommend products, and analyze reviews.

## **Data**
### **Data Sources**
- **Customer Data**: Website registrations, purchase history, and user interactions.
- **Product Data**: Supplier information, product catalogs, internal databases.
- **Review Data**: Customer feedback, ratings, and social media insights.

### **Data Issues**
- **Missing Data**: Incomplete customer profiles, missing product details.
- **Inconsistencies**: Variations in product descriptions, customer demographics.

### **Types of Data**
- **Structured Data**: Customer details, order history, product catalogs.
- **Unstructured Data**: Customer reviews, social media comments.
